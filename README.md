Hello 👋! I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Canterbury, balancing academic rigour with real-world experience as a full-stack developer at a burgeoning software startup in Christchurch. Passionate about technological innovation, I'm also in the early stages of launching my own tech startup aimed at revolutionizing the farming marketplace.

I specialize in building intuitive, scalable applications that drive business value. I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and have a knack for solving complex problems.

🌱 Entrepreneurial Spirit:
My interest doesn't stop at coding. I am currently working on a startup that aims to optimize this market by reducing middleman involvement and offering real-time pricing information.
